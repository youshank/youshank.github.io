subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

Hello there, I am You Sheng! I am currently in my third year of studies in the National University of Singapore and I am currently majoring in Data Science & Analytics. I have a small side interest towards modelling infectious diseases and epidemiology and so I love playing around with data regarding these issues.

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

Feel free to reach out to me to ask me anything or if you are keen on collaboration!

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

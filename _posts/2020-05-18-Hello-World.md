This is my very first post and it's gonna be kind of an introductory post as to what I'm going to be doing here. I am still a student just trying to figure out **MANY** things in this huge world of data science and I am always open to learning and collaborating on data science projects if anyone is keen! So if you are looking for some help and just need someone to help out (and you don't mind passing me some knowledge of your own), do hit me up.

I am currently working on some projects of my own and practicing my data science skills with R and Python everyday. One area I am quite keen on exploring would be public health and epidemiology and if anyone has any datasets or projects related to this, I would definitely love to work on it with you!

When I need a break from staring at computer screens for hours, I usually go for a good bouldering session with friends or play a game or two of Ultimate Frisbee. But within a few hours I would be back to _grinding_ programs and rushing assignments (woes of a student).

Alright, that's about it, see ya in the next post!
